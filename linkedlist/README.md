# Linked List #
Sure you can just use the Java Collections List but where is the fun in that. There is little to learn by using List, but
there is a lot to learn by creating one yourself.

You task, is to write an implementation of a LinkedList. A LinkedList is a data structure where each element contains
the data and a pointer to the next element, eg
 ![image](Linkedlist.png)
 
You will need two classes at least, one for the API to the list (call this class MyLinkedList), plus one to store 
whatever data is in the List elements (called Node maybe)

Your implementation should consider inserting items at the end of the list only (for the moment) plus printing all
the elements of the list (ie List traversal)

## Bonus Material ##
* Be able to remove any element
  * What things do you have to consider. How would you delete C in the List above without breaking the chain.
* Add an isEmpty method
* Add a size method
* Allow insertions at any point
* Change to a doubly Linked List
* By reusing your underlying data structure (Node), implement a Stack and a Queue (so 2 more classes)
